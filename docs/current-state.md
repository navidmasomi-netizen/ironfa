## 6. Recent Hardening and Cleanup Work

### Runtime Model Hardening
A normalized runtime user path is now active.

Implemented:
- `normalizePersistedUser(...)`
- normalized demo login path
- normalized runtime user usage inside `GymApp`

### Compatibility Debt Reduction
Compatibility cleanup has progressed.

Already reduced:
- runtime logic now relies more on normalized user structure
- onboarding output is normalized before persistence
- filtering and recommendation helpers self-normalize
- demo user and signup seed are leaner and closer to V1
- static programs now use cleaner goal and level vocabulary
- shared goal and level label maps exist
- active UI display paths now use normalized goal/level helpers more consistently
- write paths no longer store `goal_label` explicitly for new onboarding/signup flows
- active exercise metadata objects no longer store legacy `muscle` and `level` fields

Remaining compatibility debt is now mostly intentional and limited to:
- legacy aliases preserved in `normalizePersistedUser(...)`
- compatibility fields preserved where needed to avoid breaking older persisted state

### Runtime Verification Path
A real local verification path now exists.

Implemented:
- local installable runtime dependencies
- buildable runtime harness inside the repo
- browser-openable local app URL for manual checklist execution
- completed browser verification for:
  - authentication and session
  - onboarding
  - recommendation and static programs
  - workout logging and completion
  - persistence and restore behavior
  - progress tab
  - AI tab
- completed spot-check verification for:
  - adaptive prescription notes in the programs tab
  - progression labels and explanation copy in the workout tab

## 7. Current Engine Behavior Status

### Fully Active Enough
These are active enough to be considered real implemented baselines:
- onboarding V1 input model
- split selection baseline
- metadata filtering baseline
- substitution baseline
- recommended program activation
- static program alignment
- goal-specific programming prescriptions
- workout logging baseline
- workout completion baseline
- progress persistence baseline
- prescription adherence tracking
- trust/disclaimer baseline
- progression-aware workout guidance
- workout-screen prescription/adherence polish
- adherence-aware completion guidance
- history-aware progression guidance
- runtime state hardening for persisted data and restored flow
- separated active workout draft from persisted history
- deeper explainability inside workout feedback
- history-aware prescription adjustment inside the plan layer
- adaptive plans driven only by completed workout history
- safer program switching without cross-plan draft leakage
- safer progress weight entry validation
- safer program/day switching without stale form carry-over
- progress analytics now align with completed-history-only persistence
- safer restore fallback when the current exercise selection becomes stale

### Partially Implemented but Improving
These are active but still baseline-level:
- deeper volume auto-adjustment
- full removal of all legacy aliases

---

## 8. Current Goal-Specific Programming Status

### Hypertrophy Baseline
Implemented:
- moderate-to-higher set prescriptions
- moderate rep targets
- controlled proximity to failure
- moderate rest structure

### Strength Baseline
Implemented:
- lower rep prescriptions
- longer rest prescriptions
- more technique-focused effort tone
- heavier emphasis on compound lifts

### Fat Loss Baseline
Implemented:
- denser prescriptions
- shorter rest structure
- controlled fatigue and session density

### Recomposition Baseline
Implemented:
- balanced prescription style
- moderate sets and moderate fatigue
- sustainable mixed direction

This means programs are no longer only split + exercise names. They now carry baseline training prescriptions.

The workout layer now also uses recent history to suggest the next session target for the active movement, and can hold or consolidate instead of always pushing progression.

The progression layer now also reads a longer cycle from accumulated history, so it can move between accumulation, intensification, stabilization, and reset instead of reacting only to the last few logs.

The program layer now also uses session history to slightly reduce, hold, or progress prescriptions before the user even enters the workout screen.

Adaptive plans now read only completed workout history, so unfinished session drafts do not distort the next recommendation.

The runtime layer now also cleans and stabilizes persisted data before using it inside the main loop, and no longer mixes the active session draft with workout history.

The program layer now also explains why the current recommendation was chosen and what future behavior may change it.

The workout layer now also explains why it suggests holding, consolidating, or progressing, and why the completion popup gives a particular next-step message.

---

## 9. Current Real Product Loop

The current MVP backbone now looks like this:

1. user signs up or logs in
2. user completes V1 onboarding
3. app normalizes user model
4. split selection baseline chooses a split
5. recommended program is generated
6. static programs are also adapted to the user
7. user activates a program
8. user selects a day
9. user logs sets with program/day context
10. app shows save feedback
11. app measures day coverage and prescription adherence
12. app suggests the next progression target for the active exercise
13. app checks recent movement history before deciding whether to push, hold, or consolidate
14. workout screen shows active-day adherence, remaining work, and prescription actions
15. user completes workout
16. app shows session summary and adherence-aware next-step guidance
17. progress and logs persist across sessions
18. app sanitizes persisted state and corrects invalid restored selections
19. progress tab reflects adherence and session-level progress
20. programs tab explains why the current recommendation was chosen and what may change it
21. workout loop explains why progression and completion guidance were chosen
22. the plan layer adjusts prescription details from accumulated session history
23. adaptive planning ignores unfinished session drafts and reads only completed history
24. progression can now switch into longer-cycle accumulation, intensification, stabilization, and reset behavior

This is the strongest implemented loop so far.

## 10. What Is Stable Enough Right Now

Stable enough:
- onboarding rewrite direction
- split selection baseline
- program activation flow
- day-aware workout flow
- recommendation and static-program prescription layer
- logging with context
- completion popup summary
- adherence tracking
- progression-aware workout guidance
- history-aware progression logic
- workout-screen prescription guidance
- adherence-aware completion feedback
- runtime stability around persisted data
- persistence for key loop data
- explainable recommendation layer
- explainable workout feedback layer
- history-aware prescription adaptation
- longer-cycle progression behavior beyond the short-horizon hint layer
- adaptive plans isolated from active workout drafts
- progress tab baseline
- richer trend analysis inside the progress tab
- goal-specific progress interpretation inside the progress tab
- limitation-aware AI safety shaping in both prompt construction and visible UI state
- normalized runtime user approach
- trust/disclaimer baseline

Not yet fully hardened:
- deeper volume-management rules across many weeks
- richer explanation of why specific exercises were chosen inside exercise-level selection too
- perfect app-wide normalization
- full test/runtime verification

---

## 11. What Should Not Be Reopened Casually

The following are effectively locked for version 1 direction:
- workout-first product direction
- rule-based engine approach
- support for hypertrophy / strength / fat loss / recomposition
- lean onboarding approach
- beginner/intermediate first orientation
- split selection as a real engine layer
- metadata-driven filtering and substitution
- implementation-first execution rather than endless new specs

These should not be reopened without a strong reason.

---

## 12. Immediate Next Logical Work

The most logical next work items are:

1. turn progression guidance into actual auto-updating prescription behavior over time
2. reduce remaining compatibility debt
3. keep hardening the current loop with runtime verification
4. connect explainability more directly to long-cycle auto-adjustments over time
5. strengthen release-candidate regression confidence

---

## 13. Recommended Next Focus

Recommended next focus:
- continue implementation from the current repo and file
- stay on engine and workout-loop issues
- avoid drifting into unrelated side features
- keep working from `/Users/user/Desktop/Gym App/gym-app.jsx`

If continuing from the current momentum, the best next topic is:
- deeper compatibility cleanup
or
- runtime verification of the current adaptive loop
